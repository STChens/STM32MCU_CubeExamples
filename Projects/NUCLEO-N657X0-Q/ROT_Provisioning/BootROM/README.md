## <b>BootROM related scripts description</b>

This section provides the necessary scripts to generate and program BootROM keys.

To ease the configuration process, enable_secure_boot, keys_generation, and keys_programming scripts are used.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-N657X0-Q (MB1940) board and can be easily tailored for
    STM32N6xx devices by following these steps
    (more details in the wiki article [<b>How to create ROT examples for STM32N6</b>](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Security:How_to_create_ROT_examples_for_STM32N6)).

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

The keys_generation script generate BOOTROM new keys in the folder \Keys\.

The keys_programming script program necessary keys that allows BootROM to run signed/encrypted images.

The enable_secure_boot script allows the switching of the device to CLOSED_LOCKED state. After this step the BootROM only accepts signed images.
